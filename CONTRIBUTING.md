I'm not to bothered about how you contribute

It just has to follow the direction that you think I'm going with the program, unless you think your direction is better

I'm more likely to accept a pull request if it's clear what you're doing, i.e. with comments, editor folds and clear code

I'll probably accept a bug fix or something that makes the program work better, but only if I know why it works

I realise this is hard to do in java, but please try. Don't be the guys below.
